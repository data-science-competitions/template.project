Description: Using this template reduces:  
    * Unnecessary variance between projects configurations; and  
    * Development time spent on making a barebone project working for the first time.    
    This is possible as the boilerplate comes with:    
    * Fully configured test-suite, including code-coverage; and  
    * Fully configured continuous-integration (CI) script for Travis.
